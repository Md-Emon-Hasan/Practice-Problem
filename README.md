## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for practicing and improving your data science skills. It includes a variety of datasets and challenges, each aimed at different aspects of the data science pipeline. Whether you are looking to hone your skills in data cleaning, feature selection, or model evaluation, this repository has something for you.

## Datasets

Each practice problem comes with its own dataset, which may include various types of data, such as:

- **Tabular Data**: Structured data in CSV format.
- **Time Series Data**: Sequential data points collected over time.
- **Text Data**: Unstructured data such as text files or documents.
- **Image Data**: Visual data in formats like JPG or PNG.

## Getting Started

To get started with the practice problems, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Explore the Problems:**

   Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to explore the Jupyter notebooks associated with each practice problem.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains datasets for each practice problem.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for problem exploration, data analysis, and model building.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.
- **results/**: Stores output files such as model predictions, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies needed to run the notebooks and scripts.

## Contributing
